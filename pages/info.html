		<p>The <span class="inst">snare drum</span> is used to highlight particular parts in a song or piece of music. Coupled with the bass drum, the snare drum typically designates the tempo of the music. In most rock and pop music, you will hear the snare drum on beats 2 and 4 in 4/4 tempo songs.</p>

		<img class="info-pic" src="../pictures/bassdrum.jpg" alt="bass drum">
		<p>The <span class="inst">bass drum</span>, coupled with the snare drum, provides the backbone of the music. It's the element that really drives the music forward. In most rock and pop music, you will hear the bass drum on the first and third beats in 4/4 tempo songs.</p>

		<img class="info-pic" src="../pictures/tomtom1.jpg" alt="tom tom">
		<p>A <span class="inst">tom tom</span> provides filling to the music. Whereas the snare drum provides crisp, sharp, and pitchless sounds, a tom tom produces a specific pitch without the snare-like sound.

		<img class="info-pic" src="../pictures/hihat.jpg" alt="hi hat">
		<p>The <span class="inst">hi hat</span> goes next to the snare drum in a typical drum set set-up. It can open and close with the pressing and releasing of a pedal controlled by a drummer's left foot if the drummer is right handed. Otherwise, the hi hat will be on the right side of the drummer. It makes a chick sound when closed and a washy, metallic sound when open.</p>

		<img class="info-pic" src="../pictures/ridecymbal.jpg" alt="ride cymbal">
		<p>A <span class="inst">ride cymbal</span> serves a similar function as a hi hat. The main difference is the amount of resonance and sound it makes. A ride cymbal makes a deeper and richer metallic sound which can add a smoothness to the music.</p>

		<img class="info-pic" src="../pictures/chinacymbal.jpg" alt="china cymbal">
		<p>A <span class="inst">china cymbal</span> is another "effects" cymbal. However, instead of its main use being for periodic effects, a china cymbal can be used as a crash cymbal or in lieu of a hi hat or ride cymbal.</p>

		<img class="info-pic" src="../pictures/bellcymbal.jpg" alt="bell cymbal">
		<p>A <span class="inst">bell cymbal</span> is another "effects" cymbal. It makes a sharp, pingy sound and is used to add special effects to the music.</p>

		<p>An <span class="inst">electric drum</span> is a special effects instrument. It must be plugged into an amplifier to be heard when played. Depending on the drum "brain"--which is used to control the settings on electric drums--it can be tuned to many different sound effects, not exclusive to snare drum sounds.</p>

		<img class="info-pic" src="../pictures/electricbassdrum.jpg" alt="electric bass drum">
